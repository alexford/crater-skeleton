Crater Skeleton
===============

Based on Skeleton v1.2 (https://github.com/dhgamache/Skeleton)

I've been working on a base starting point/boilerplate to use for static/marketing sites (not webapps), and found Skeleton to be the closest thing to my needs. This is Skeleton with some modifications. Main modifications are:

1. Use of LESS and including only one CSS file in the <head>
2. Removal of HTML comments outlining page structure
3. Removal of tabs tool
4. Shortening directory names (I prefer 'css' to 'stylesheets', 'img' to 'images', etc.)
5. Adding some common LESS mixins and a file structure I like to use.
